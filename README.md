# C++ Spatial Index (RTree)

The management and indexing of geospatial data is a very important research topic in computer science.
One of the most significant and well-known data structures for storing and searching geospatial data is the R-tree.
In this thesis, we aim to implement an efficient and effective version of the R-tree using the C++ programming language.
The R-tree structure allows for efficient search and processing of multidimensional data based on the overlap of MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle).
The main goal of this thesis is to initially index our data using the R-tree and then use this indexing to efficiently answer geospatial queries, such as join,
range, and nearest neighbor queries. This implementation is based on the Java Spatial Index (JSI) library, which we studied to adapt its principles and create the indexing in C++.
In this way, we aim to improve the performance and scalability of geospatial data management systems, thus contributing to the advancement of geospatial data processing technologies.
