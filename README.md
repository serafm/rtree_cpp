# C++ Spatial Index (RTree)

The management and indexing of geospatial data is a crucial research topic for computer science.
One of the most important and well-known data structures
for storing and searching geospatial data is R-tree.
This thesis implements an efficient and effective
version of an R-tree using C++ programming language.
The R-tree structure allows efficient search and processing of multidimensional
data based on the MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) overlay.
The main goal of the thesis is to index the data using the R-tree data structure.
Subsequently, indexing is used for efficient information retrieval in geospatial
queries such as join, range and nearest neighbor queries.
The creation of the new index aims to improve the index creation and query performance.
Finally, experiments are presented to demonstrate practically the improvement and
performance of an R-tree.
